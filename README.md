### TL;DR
> I failed to get a dev job last year. I'm relearning my skills, getting back on track. 

### Hello, I'm ThuRein. You can call me Tom. 

In 2022 March, I started learning MERN stack. In 2023 August I prepared my portfolio and started looking for web developer job in Thailand. I didn't succeed. After about 6 months I started looking for other jobs and did non-tech related jobs. But I couldn't picture my life meaningful if I wouldn't work in the tech industry. 

Today, I realized many people learned tech skills during 2020 COVID period. Many businesses go remote. Harvard offered free CS50 online courses and many other well-known universites did the same. People had time and learning resources for tech skills. And many people did learn.

I realized my tiny web knowledge was insufficient to work as a professional in high demand global tech industry. I should've learned more instead of giving up. I'm going to relearn my programming skills, expand my CS knowlege. Instead of worshipping JavaScript; I'm going to have to relearn all the CS basics and expand my knowledge into Machine Learning and AI.
