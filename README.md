# progress
## This repo is the record of my progress. It is for my future employers, hiring managers and collegues to comporehend my progress and skills I've learned. 

Hello, I'm Thurein. In 2022 March, I started learning MERN stack. In 2023 August I prepared my portfolio and started looking for web developer job in Thailand. I didn't succeed. After about 6 months I started looking for other jobs and did non-tech related jobs. But I cannot picture my life meaningful. I need to get into the tech industry. Now, I realize many people learned tech skills during 2020 COVID period. Many businesses go remote. Harvard offered free CS50 online courses and many other well-known universites did the same. People had time and learning resources for tech skills. Now I realized my tiny web knowledge was insufficient to work as a professional in high demand global tech industry. I should've learned more instead of giving up. Now I'm back. I'm going to relearn my programming skills, expand my CS knowlege. Instead of worshipping JavaScript and get stuck my tiny web knowledge; I'm going to relearn all the CS basics and learn further into Machine Learning and AI.
