## Summary
Last year, I struggled to secure a developer job. I’m now in the process of relearning and enhancing my skills to get back on track. I’m expanding my knowledge beyond the MERN stack to include core computer science concepts, Machine Learning, and AI.

visit [Progress Journald](#progress-journald). **Skillsets** are included to gauge my tech stacks.

## Hello, I’m ThuRein, you can call me Tom.

In March 2022, I started learning the MERN stack. By August 2023, I had prepared my portfolio and started my search for a web developer position in Thailand. Unfortunately, I wasn’t successful in landing a role. After six months, I shifted to non-tech jobs, but I realized that working in technology is where I find true purpose.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people had the opportunity to learn tech skills as remote work became prevalent and educational resources became more accessible. Harvard and other top universities offered free online courses like CS50, and many took advantage of these opportunities to build their tech expertise.

Reflecting on my experience, I understand that my initial web knowledge wasn’t sufficient for the competitive global tech industry. Instead of giving up, I now recognize the importance of expanding my skill set. My plan is to go beyond JavaScript and expand my knowledge and skill in foundational computer science concepts, as well as explore Machine Learning and AI.

I’m committed to enhancing my programming skills and broadening my understanding of the tech field. This is a crucial step towards achieving my career goals and making a meaningful impact in the tech industry.

> Progress Updates: I update my progress several times a week, documenting everything I learn and build. You can follow my journey and view detailed updates in this progress journal.

### Git, Vite and Vanilla JS for tic-tac-toe game (Aug 3-6)

> Over the past few days, I have been revisiting the rationale behind using libraries and frameworks like React and Vue. To deepen my understanding, I implemented a tic-tac-toe game using vanilla JavaScript. During this process, I encountered CORS policy issues when using modules for cleaner code, which highlighted the practical benefits of these tools and frameworks.

> Additionally, I have started incorporating JSDoc comments to improve code documentation, an area where I previously lacked discipline.

> Regarding Git, I am focusing on mastering merging techniques and expanding my knowledge of git rebase, which is a new concept for me. I recognize that there is much more to learn to fully grasp Git’s capabilities.

### MVC Architecture with Vanilla JS (Aug 4-9)
#### Repository: [Reinventing Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/thureindev/twist-tac-toe/)

> Developed an object-oriented MVC architecture for the tic-tac-toe game previously implemented with a sequential code structure. Continued using vanilla JavaScript, without relying on external libraries or frameworks. The updated game features an expandable board, adjustable winning conditions, and is designed to accommodate new game modes. This project provided valuable hands-on experience in transitioning from a sequential code structure to object-oriented programming.

### Refactoring and Learning OOP Patterns (Aug 12-14)
#### Repository: [Twist-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/thureindev/twist-tac-toe/app-vanilla-js/)

> Spent some days adding new features. Proper refactoring is incredibly effective for learning programming patterns. While I am using Git effectively, I still need to deepen my understanding of `git rebase`. Tomorrow, I will finalize the Vanilla JavaScript version of the game and transition to working with Flutter and Vue for the frontend. I plan to develop the same tic-tac-toe game in a new development environment. Following that, I aim to build an online multiplayer matchmaking server. 

### Refactoring Challenges (Aug 15-16)
#### Repository: [Twist-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/thureindev/twist-tac-toe/app-vanilla-js/)

> Refactoring again as new issues came up with previous changes, leading to a review of class properties and methods. However, time well spent for improving the code. I will complete the refactor tomorrow and finally start server-side and frontend development with Vue or Flutter.

### Completed Vanilla Version; Exploring Vue and Flutter Next (Aug 17)
#### Repository: [Twist-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/thureindev/twist-tac-toe/app-vanilla-js/)
##### Accomplishments:
> Finalized Vanilla Version: Completed and committed the final version of the vanilla JavaScript implementation of Twist-Tac-Toe.

> Git Proficiency: Gained hands-on experience with Git, specifically in understanding the concept of git merge. Experimented with various mockup directories and file structures to solidify my knowledge.

##### Next Steps:
> Exploration: I am reviewing articles on Vue.js and Flutter tonight to decide which framework aligns best with my learning goals and project needs.
