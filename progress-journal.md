## Git, Vite and Vanilla JS for tic-tac-toe game (Aug 3-6)

For the past few days I've been relearning why we need to use libraries and frameworks such as React, Vue etc. I coded tic-tac-toe game in vanilla JavaScript and encountered CORS policy problems when I tried to use modules for clean code. To be honest, I never quite understood why we need to use React, Vue or such libs and frameworks. Now, as I implement plain old ES6 code, I think I quite understood why we need to use such and such tools and techniques.

I'm also making use of JSDoc comments to keep my code well documented. Honestly, I've never had the practice of documenting and appropriately commenting the code in attempt for clean code.

For git I need to understand more about merging techniques. and I have no idea what git rebase is. 


## Using Vanilla JS (Aug 4-9)

I took some days writing only in Vanilla JS. Except using Array Prototype functions and JS script defined objects, no library, no framework is used. I wrote a fully object oriented, Modal-View-Controller code for tic-tac-toe game. So far I've got a working classic tic-tac-toe game in expandable board, adjustable winning length, ready to scale into new gameplays and customized rules. It was fun and had a lot of insightful moments writing plain, raw JavaScript.
