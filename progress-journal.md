#Git, Vite and Vanilla JS for tic-tac-toe game
## Relearning why we need to use those tools. (Aug 3-6)

For the past few days I've been relearning why we need to use libraries and frameworks such as React, Vue etc. I coded tic-tac-toe game in vanilla JavaScript and encountered CORS policy problems when I tried to use modules for clean code. To be honest, I never quite understood why we need to use React, Vue or such libs and frameworks. Now, as I implement plain old ES6 code, I think I quite understood why we need to use such and such tools and techniques.

I'm also making use of JSDoc comments to keep my code well documented. Honestly, I've never had the practice of documenting and appropriately commenting the code in attempt for clean code.

For git I need to understand more about merging techniques. and I have no idea what git rebase is.
